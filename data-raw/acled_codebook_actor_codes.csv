'Inter Code',Name,Description
1,State forces,"State forces are defined as collective actors, including military and police, that are recognized to perform government functions over a given territory. Government actors are named by ACLED as a series of separate regimes rather than a uniform body. For example, the government regimes in the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo since 1965 are recorded as Congo/Zaire (1965-1997), Democratic Republic of Congo (1997-2001), and Democratic Republic of Congo (2001-2019) as opposed to Congo/Zaire (1965-present). As the strength, capacity, and policies of governments can vary widely from one regime to the next, ACLED designates governments by their leading regimes. This enables researchers to capture the differences in government involvement and reaction to violence. 
As militaries and police forces are a direct arm of the government, these actors are noted as Military Forces of State (Year-Year) or Police Forces of State (Year-Year). Mutinies of militaries are recorded as Mutiny of Military Forces of State (Year-Year). Various units of these state forces are recorded distinctly as well – such as Police Forces of India (2014-) Assam Rifles or Police Forces of the Philippines (2016-) Anti-Illegal Drugs Special Operations Task Force – given that such units can engage in distinct patterns of behavior. Pro-government militias with indirect links to the state are not included as state forces, given their deliberate distance from formal ties to the state.
It is important to note that this classification of state forces does not imply legitimacy, but rather acknowledges the de facto exercise of authority over a territory. This is why, in a limited number of cases, ACLED records government actors in states with limited or no recognition as state forces. These states are not necessarily recorded separately in the ‘Country’ column, but their government forces are recorded as distinct state actors. For example, the Military Forces of Somaliland (1991-) actor is recorded, though its country of activity is recorded in the ‘Country’ column as Somalia, not Somaliland.
In cases where the authority of a government is severely challenged, or where two or more groups have a claim to be the government (with an associated military), a distinct choice is made about how to proceed with coding – often resulting in both actors being recorded as state forces. For example, there are competing state forces recorded as active in Libya from 2014 onwards and in Yemen from 2015 onwards."
2,Rebel groups,"Rebel groups are defined as political organizations with the goal of countering an established national governing regime through violence. Rebel groups are named according to the title they publicly use to represent themselves. The designation as a rebel group means that the group has a stated political agenda for national power (either through regime replacement or separatism), is acknowledged beyond the ranks of immediate members, and uses violence as its primary means to pursue political goals.
Rebel forces are known by a specific chosen name and the groups are open and transparent about their intentions and leadership. They typically operate within and across states, and conduct activity against the central governments and their associates. Rebel groups often have predecessors and successors due to diverging goals within their membership. If splinter groups or factions within a group emerge, these are recorded as distinct actors. 
In cases where aggregate groups are contesting the government, we often use an overarching name rather than factions (e.g. Hutu Rebels active in Burundi; Malay Muslim Separatists active in Thailand; Opposition Rebels in Syria)."
3,Political militias,"Political militias are a diverse set of violent actors that are often created for a specific purpose or during a specific time period (e.g. the Janjaweed, largely active in Sudan) and for the furtherance of a political goal by violence. Political militias are recorded by their stated name. These organizations are defined by their political goals of influencing and impacting governance, security, and policy. However, these groups are not seeking the removal of a national power, but are instead typically supported, armed by, or allied with a political elite and act towards a goal defined by these elites or larger political movements. Political militias often operate in conjunction, or in alliance, with a recognized government, governor, military leader, rebel organization, political party, business elite, or opposition group. Whereas some opposition parties have a militia arm, groups such as the Sudanese Janjaweed or Serbian Tigers are pro-government militias that work as supplements to government power yet maintain indirect links to such power.
These groups are not subsumed within the category of government or opposition, but are noted as an armed, distinct, yet associated, wing given their purposeful indirect ties to the state. These political militias may be associated with defined ethnic, regional, or other identity communities, but they also operate outside of ethnic homelands and for goals other than the promotion of ethnic interests. As such, they are recorded as political militias as opposed to identity militias (more on that below). The Gulf Clan of Colombia, War Veterans Group in Zimbabwe, and Mayi-Mayi of the Democratic Republic of Congo are examples of these groups.
At times, unidentified armed groups perpetrate political violence. These groups often operate like political militias as they can be used by elites under the cover of anonymity. In some cases, perpetrators are unidentified due to reporting challenges or the absence of detailed information in a particular conflict context; in other – perhaps more common – cases, such groups purposefully work to"
4,Identity militias,"ACLED includes a broad category of identity militias for armed and violent groups organized around a collective, common feature, including: community, ethnicity, region, religion, or – in exceptional cases – livelihood. Therefore, for ACLED’s purposes, identity militias include those identified as tribal, communal, ethnic, local, clan, religious, and caste militias in source reporting. Events involving identity militias are often referred to as communal violence, as these violent groups typically act locally in pursuit of local goals, resources, power, security, and retribution.
An armed group claiming to operate on behalf of a larger identity community may be associated with that community, but not represent it (i.e. Luo Ethnic Militia in Kenya or Fulani Ethnic Militia in Nigeria). Rather, the identity aspect refers to recruitment and participation in these groups being determined by association with the identity of the group"
5,Rioters,"Rioters, loosely assembled groups of individuals or mobs without inherent organization, engage in violence while participating in demonstrations or engage in violence that is spontaneous. While less common, rioters may also include groups that engage in premeditated violence for transient and limited purposes (e.g. a vigilante mob that mobilizes for perceived justice). They are noted by a general category of Rioters (Country). If a named organized group is affiliated with or leading an event (for example, a political party or labor union), the associated group is named in the respective ‘Associated Actor’ column. Rioters are, by definition, violent or destructive and may engage in a wide array of violent or destructive acts, including property destruction, engaging with other armed groups (e.g. security forces, private security firms, etc.), or in violence against unarmed civilians. While the activity of rioters, by definition, falls outside the remit of an organized armed group, rioters may sometimes be armed and/or organized in a spontaneous or atomic manner"
6,Protesters,"Protesters are peaceful demonstrators, noted by a general category of Protesters (Country). If a group is affiliated with or leading an event (e.g. Movement for Democratic Change political party), the associated group is named in the respective ‘Associated Actor’ column. Although protesters are non-violent, they may be the targets of violence by other groups (e.g. security institutions, private security firms, or other armed actors)."
7,Civilians,"Civilians, in whatever number or association, are victims of violent acts within ACLED as they are – by definition – unarmed and, hence, vulnerable. They are noted as Civilians (Country). If targeted with violence in situations where they are caught unarmed, some normally armed actors may be recorded as civilians. Examples include off-duty state soldiers targeted in their homes, or members of armed groups subject to violence or executed while imprisoned."
8,External/Other forces,"Small categories of external or other actors include: international organizations, state forces active outside of their main country of operation, private security firms and their armed employees, and hired mercenaries acting independently. They are noted by their name and actions. The military forces of states are recorded with an ‘Inter’ code of 8 (i.e. external forces) when active outside of their home state (e.g. the military of Turkey active in northern Syria)."
